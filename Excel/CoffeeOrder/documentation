Project: Sales Analysis with MS Excel

DataSet:

Description: A well-curated product dataset containing customer information and their coffee orders, along with details of the coffee products they have purchased.
I used advanced Excel functions to analyze and visualize customer purchase data. By employing XLOOKUP and row/column indexing, an Orders table was created from multiple data sources. Three Pivot Tables were then generated from this table to summarize the data, and visualizations were created for insights.
To improve usability, four slicers were added for easy data filtering. These slicers, combined with the visualizations, form an interactive dashboard. 

During the analysis, I examined and graphed the following (KPIs):

1. Total Sales Over Time (Sliced over Monthly data)
2. Country-wise Sales Analysis 
3. Top 5 Customer Purchase Analysis
4. Enhanced Dashboard Interactivity with Filters: Roast Type, Loyalty Card, and Bag Size

This project showcases Excel's capabilities in data analysis and visualization, demonstrating its effectiveness in deriving insights from complex datasets.
